# Video 7

# Compute distances
distances = dist(movies[2:20], method = "euclidean")

# Hierarchical clustering
clusterMovies = hclust(distances, method = "ward") 

# Plot the dendrogram
plot(clusterMovies)

# Assign points to clusters
clusterGroups = cutree(clusterMovies, k = 10)

#Now let's figure out what the clusters are like.

# Let's use the tapply function to compute the percentage of movies in each genre and cluster

tapply(movies$Action, clusterGroups, mean)
tapply(movies$Romance, clusterGroups, mean)

# We can repeat this for each genre. If you do, you get the results in ClusterMeans.ods


# Find which cluster Men in Black is in.

subset(movies, Title=="Men in Black (1997)")
clusterGroups[257]

# Create a new data set with just the movies from cluster 2
cluster2 = subset(movies, clusterGroups==2)

# Look at the first 10 titles in this cluster:
cluster2$Title[1:10]

# Run the cutree function again to create the cluster groups, but this time pick
# k = 2 clusters. It turns out that the algorithm groups all of the movies that 
# only belong to one specific genre in one cluster (cluster 2), and puts all of 
# the other movies in the other cluster (cluster 1). What is the genre that all 
# of the movies in cluster 2 belong to?
