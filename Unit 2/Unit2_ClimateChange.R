# Climate Change

# Problem 1
# Problem 1.1 - Creating Our First Model
# Enter the model R2 (the "Multiple R-squared" value)

# Problem 1.2 - Creating Our First Model
# Which variables are significant in the model?

# Problem 2
# Problem 2.1 - Understanding the Model
# Which of the following is the simplest correct explanation for this contradiction?
# N2O and CFC.11 are correlated with other variables in the data set

# Problem 2.2 - Understanding the Model
# Which of the following independent variables is N2O highly correlated with (absolute correlation greater than 0.7)?
# Which of the following independent variables is CFC.11 highly correlated with? Select all that apply.

# Problem 3 - Simplifying the Model
# Enter the coefficient of N2O in this reduced model
# Enter the model R2

# Enter the R2 value of the model produced by the step function
